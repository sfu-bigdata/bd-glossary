SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el" or "sequel") stands for Structured [Query](#query) Language. SQL is a language that works with structured, [tabular data](#tabular-data) allowing to query and construct such data. It forms a standard for many [database](#database) systems. [^28] [^34] [#processing](#processing) [#lesson-07](#lesson-07) [#lesson-10](#lesson-10) [#lesson-11](#lesson-11) [#lesson-12](#lesson-12)

### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of [variance](#variance). It is a measure of dispersion, meaning of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. [#lesson-05](#lesson-05) [#lesson-09](#lesson-09)

### Statistics

Statistics is the discipline concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting empirical data. Common statistical metrics are mean (average), median, mode and percentiles. [#data-analysis](#data-analysis) [#lesson-05](#lesson-05) [#arithmetic-operations](#arithmetic-operations)

### Storytelling

The ability to tell or write stories and narratives to communicate insights and actions drawn data, optionally aided by effective [visualizations](#visualization). [^59] [#disciplines](#disciplines) [#lesson-13](#lesson-13)

### String or character operations

Manipulations with [string data types](#data-types) include the following. [#operations](#operations) [#lesson-08](#lesson-08)

#### Parse

To analyze (a string or text) into logical syntactic components.[^52]

#### Indexing

Indexing (or selecting) string characters by their position, _zeroth_ character, the _first_ character, etc.

#### Concatenation

Combining items (strings) end-to-end.

### Structured Data

[Data](#data) that is organized into clearly defined fields associated with variables or attributes, such as dates, words, or numbers that are recorded for each observation or item. Items are often represented as rows of [tabular spreadsheets](#tabular-data) that can be stored in a [database](#database) for easy processing and analysis.[^24],[^25] [#data-types](#data-types) [#lesson-03](#lesson-03)

### Tabular Data

Data items or observations organized as rows, containing entries, under columns, that correspond to separate kinds of values or attributes. The intersection of a row and a column is a cell, which corresponds to individual data values. [^30],[^31] [#data-types](#data-types) [#lesson-03](#lesson-03)

- Synonyms: row(s), record(s), example(s), observation(s), measurement(s), fact(s), point(s) and other items of information
- Synonyms: column(s) also referred to as field(s), header(s), attribute(s), [feature(s)](#feature), property(ies), variable(s), key(s) (as in key-value), factor(s), dimension(s)
- Synonyms: pairs, key-value, attribute-value

#### Narrow table format

Narrow, stacked or long, is presented with one column containing all data values and another column containing the kind of values. Related topic [pivot](#pivot). [#data-types](#data-types) [#lesson-03](#lesson-03)

#### Wide table format 

Wide, or unstacked tabular data presetns each [variable/attribute/feature]() in a separate column. Related topic [pivot](#pivot). [#data-types](#data-types) [#lesson-03](#lesson-03)

### Text Mining

A process of analyzing [text](#unstructured-data) to capture key concepts, themes, relationships and trends.[^36] [#data-analysis](#data-analysis)

### Tidy tables

Datasets are commonly messy. Getting data into tidy [^51] format requires upfront work, but that work pays off in the long term. There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

1.	Each variable must have its own column.
2.	Each observation must have its own row.
3.	Each value must have its own cell.

[#lesson-06](#lesson-06)

### Time Series

A sequence of values associated with successive times.
[#lesson-08](#lesson-08) [#lesson-13](#lesson-13)

### Transpose

A mathematical operation on a table where a new table is obtained by interchanging each row and the corresponding column. [#operations](#operations) [#lesson-08](#lesson-08)

### Tree structure

A _tree_ is a widely used data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value, branches, leaves, and subtrees of children with a parent node. [^42] [#data-types](#data-types) [#data-types](#data-types) [#lesson-03](#lesson-03)

### Unbalanced Data

Whether majority or minorities groups exist in a dataset, imbalance is common and sometimes expected. [#lesson-04](#lesson-04)

### Union

A _union_ operation that [combines](#data-transformation) tables with the same number and [types](#data-types) of columns. This operation is like vertical [concatenation](#concatenation). [#query](#query) [#operations](#operations) [#lesson-12](#lesson-12)

### Unstructured Data

Data that is not organized in a pre-defined way under a single data model. Examples include text, images, audio, or video. [^26],[^27] [#data-types](#data-types), [#lesson-03](#lesson-03)

### URL

The URL (short for Uniform Resource Locator) is the location of a webpage or file (including pictures, videos, or CSV) on the Internet. Files (or resources) stored on the cloud have unique URLs. [#lesson-10](#lesson-10)

### Variance

Measure of dispersion, indicating how far the values of a variable are spread out around its [sample](#sample) mean. Low varance indicates nearly constant values throughout the [population](#population). Also see [standard deviation](#standard-deviation). [^68] [#operations](#operations) [#lesson-05](#lesson-05)

### Violin Plot

Similar to a [histogram](#histogram), this plot type shows how values of a variable are distributed in a dataset, indicating more often occurring values with thickness that extends symmetrically around a central axis. The name refers to the typical look that most datasets have in this [visualization](#visualization) method. [box plots](#box-plot) [#lesson-09](#lesson-09)

### Visualization

Visual representation of data including plots, charts, maps and infographics to support people with tasks such as sensemaking, effective communication of information, and improved pattern detection. For example, flight operations using a radar screen that displays sensor data in real-time. [^11], [^12], [^56] [#data-analysis](#data-analysis) [#lesson-05](#lesson-05) [#lesson-09](#lesson-09) [#lesson-13](#lesson-13)

<!--
### Visualization

Sometimes referred to as _Viz_. The technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate messages. _Explanatory_, or informative, visualizations are used to communicate to an audience. _Exploratory_ visuals are used to investigate and uncover unknown patterns in data.  [#data-analysis](#data-analysis) [#lesson-05](#lesson-05) [#lesson-09](#lesson-09) [#lesson-13](#lesson-13)
-->

### Visualization Dashboard

Multiple interactive graphical views of [data](#data) that would be too complex if presented in a [single visualization](#visualization), for instance, to support complex narratives and [insights](#insight) by showing key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring of a business or other processes. [#data-analysis](#data-analysis) 

### Web scraping

The practice of extracting data from webpages by automatically requesting and processing the HTML source code of these pages. Alternatively, obtaining data via a structured file format or direct database or API access is usually preferred, whenever possible. Web search engines, such as Google or Bing, are based on getting their data via web scraping. [#lesson-10](#lesson-10)

### Word Cloud

Text summary method that displays important words from a document indicating varying degree of relevance by varying the font size of the words. The most important words stand out at a glance, giving an rough idea of the topic of a text.
